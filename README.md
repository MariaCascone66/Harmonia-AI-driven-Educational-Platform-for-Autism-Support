# Harmonia — Project Management & System Design (Academic Project)

## Overview
**Harmonia** is an academic project focused on **project planning, management, and system design** for a mobile application aimed at supporting **learning, behavioral monitoring, and daily assistance** for individuals on the autism spectrum.  
The platform concept includes educational modules, behavioral assessments, social simulation tools, and a secure area for handling **sensitive healthcare data**, with a strong emphasis on **privacy and GDPR compliance**.

> ⚠️ Note: this repository contains **project management and design documentation**. The **software implementation** was developed by a separate team.

## Goals (High-level)
- Provide a **single integrated platform** supporting caregivers, teachers, and healthcare professionals.
- Enable **customizable educational activities** and progress tracking.
- Define requirements and architecture with a focus on:
  - **Accessibility & usability**
  - **Security & GDPR compliance**
  - **Cross-platform support (Android/iOS)**
  - **Real-time data processing (conceptual level)**

## Team
- **Maria Cascone** — Project Manager (coordination, planning, documentation, schedule & budget control)
- Daniele De Marzo — Software Analyst
- Nicholas Iannone — Development Lead (design coordination)

## Stakeholders / Sponsors (Project Scenario)
